Description: SEA performs simultaneous feature-set testing for (gen)omics data. It tests the unified null hypothesis and controls the family-wise error rate for all possible pathways. The unified null hypothesis is defined as: "The proportion of true features in the set is less than or equal to a threshold." Family-wise error rate control is provided through use of closed testing with Simes test. There are some practical functions to play around with the pathways of interest.
